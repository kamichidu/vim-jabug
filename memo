    -listenany
                      wait for a running VM to connect at any available address using standard connector
    -launch
                      launch VM immediately instead of waiting for 'run' command
    -listconnectors   list the connectors available in this VM
    -connect <connector-name>:<name1>=<value1>,...
                      connect to target VM using named connector with listed argument values
    -dbgtrace [flags] print info for debugging jdb
    -tclient          run the application in the HotSpot(TM) Client Compiler
    -tserver          run the application in the HotSpot(TM) Server Compiler

options forwarded to debuggee process:
    -v -verbose[:class|gc|jni]
                      turn on verbose mode
    -D<name>=<value>  set a system property
    -classpath <directories separated by ":">
                      list directories in which to look for classes
    -X<option>        non-standard target VM option

<class> is the name of the class to begin debugging
<arguments> are the arguments passed to the main() method of <class>

For command help type 'help' at jdb prompt
